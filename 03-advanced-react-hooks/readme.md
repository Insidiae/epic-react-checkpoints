We are introduced to the `useReducer` hook, which is an alternative of sorts to `useState` that has an API that is easily recognizable by someone familiar with Redux. With `useReducer`, we can still do exactly the same thing we do with `useState` (and even simulate how the old `this.setState` API works for class-based components), though one major advantage of `useReducer` is that it is more optimized to handle complex state objects (like how we merged multiple state variables into a single object in the previous workshop) by using the `dispatch` method to change specific sub-values depending on the `action.type`. We can also easily implement lazy initialization (again, like we did in the previous workshop) by passing the initializer function as a third argument to `useReducer`.

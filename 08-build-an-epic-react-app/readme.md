  1. [Use `@reach/dialog`](exercises/01/extra-1/)
  2. [Create a LoginForm component](exercises/01/extra-2/)

We start working on the Bookshelf app from scratch. We go from the very basics like rendering a simple React component, to rendering a basic login/register form. We are also introduced to the Reach UI library that helps with displaying common UI components like a modal dialog that will contain the login/registration forms.

### 2. Style React Components

  1. [Use the emotion macro](exercises/02/extra-1/)
  2. [Use colors and media queries file](exercises/02/extra-2/)
  3. [Make a loading spinner component](exercises/02/extra-3/)

We now add styles to the Bookshelf app via CSS-in-JS with the help of the Emotion library. With Emotion, we can add styles to components ala Styled Components, but we can also directly add one-off CSS styles into our components by using Emotion's `jsx` pragma and passing a `css` prop containing the styles into the component. We can also add a simple loading spinner using Emotion's `keyframes` helper.

We are introduced to our first React Hook: the `useState` hook. As the name implies, `useState` lets us use state variables, or variables that have data that may be changed over time, in our React apps. `useState` provides us two things: (1) the state variable itself, and (2) a function that we can call to set another value to the state variable. We initialize the value of our state variable in the `useState` call, letting us optionally accept a prop that can set the initial value of that state variable as the component renders for the first time.
